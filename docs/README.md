# Background Subtraction

This repository is dedicated to the implementation of a project focused on background subtraction for X-ray crystallography. It contains several directories and files, each serving a specific purpose in the project.

## Directories

- **`/crystfel_scripts`**: This directory is a crucial part of the project as it contains all the scripts from CrystFEL. These scripts are integral to the project's implementation and have been adapted to perform manual background subtraction.

- **`/src`**: This is where the source code for the project resides. It includes Python scripts for various functionalities, Jupyter notebooks for detailed review and analysis, and other code files necessary for the project.

- **`/docs`**: This directory is dedicated to the documentation of the project. It may include design documents that outline the architecture and design decisions of the project, user manuals that guide users on how to use the project, and other documentation files that provide additional information about the project.

- **`/tests`**: This directory is for the test code of the project. It may include unit tests that test individual components of the project, integration tests that test the interaction between different components, and other test files that help ensure the correctness and reliability of the project.

## Files

- **`project_2.ipynb`**: This Jupyter notebook is the heart of the project. It contains the main analysis for the project, including data loading where the data necessary for the project is loaded, data cleaning where the loaded data is cleaned and preprocessed, exploratory data analysis where the cleaned data is analyzed to gain insights, model building where a model is built based on the insights gained, and evaluation where the built model is evaluated to measure its performance.
